Side project library/framework to build better Java Swing desktop apps.

## Getting Started

This library works with Java 8+.

Get the library from
the [Maven Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/engineer.mathsoftware.jdesk/jdesk/0.1.0/jar):

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>engineer.mathsoftware.jdesk</groupId>
    <artifactId>jdesk</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle (Kotlin):

```kotlin
implementation("engineer.mathsoftware.jdesk:jdesk:0.1.0")
```

## Roadmap

Wish to get rid of legacy Swing and move forward with MVP, system architecture
and JFX. This project is going to work successfully for Java 8+ Swing
applications and MVP. I'm not going to enhance or add much more to the Swing
components. For documentation about the JDesk Swing components check POSLANS
version 0.1 alpha. This framework might be useful for someone who had legacy
Swing apps and want to enhance them and not migrate to something else.

I had mainly created this framework to avoid the annoying boilerplate code I had
to add to my Swing apps (I was getting exhausted of this Java boilerplate).

Lately, I'm adding more modern features that I will eventually port
to [DeskFX](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/deskfx). The old parts of this
framework will only be Swing and Java 8 but everything else will be pretty neat.
